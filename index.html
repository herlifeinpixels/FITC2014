        <h3>
        Dear FITC Team,
        <br />
        Let me start off by saying THANK YOU for your efforts in making this conference financially accessible to women.

        <h3>FITC 2010</h3>
        <p>
        Four years ago, my introduction to java programming professor(who also happened to be a lady) was kind enough to let me skip my exam to attend FITC 2010 as a volunteer. It was the first industry conference I’ve ever attended and it was also one of the only times I’ve happily gotten up at 5am to catch a Greyhound. The connections and the experience that I had received from the conference were invaluable. To this day, the Grammar of Interactive Design remains to be one of my favourite talks.

        <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
        <p>
        My profession slaps the following title on my resume: a front-end developer and a UX designer. But in reality I’m just a hungry, self-taught creator with tech chops who doesn’t give up easily. I picked up bits of web programming in middle school. Along the way, people have told me things from “Girls shouldn’t do programming because it is too demanding” to “It must be easier for you to find a job in tech because you’re a girl”. Luckily, I was too stubborn. When I see the speakers at FITC, I see proud, talented and hardworking people who love their craft. I see the faces of the same people published books, blogs and webcasts that taught me how to become a better designer and programmer when I had no teacher or mentor. I would mean a lot to me to experience this conference.

        <h3>Conferences</h3>
        <p>
        Last year I had an amazing time organizing <a href="http://designourtomorrow.com" target="_blank">my own conference</a>. The vision was to give young people an opportunity to receive quality creative education that schools and universities couldn’t provide. Through this experience I understood how important it was to offer opportunities to those who can’t afford it financially. As a non-profit organization, we raised every penny to bring down the prices of our tickets. We hand curated over 180 student applications, many of which were written by wonderfully talented and passionate people. I’m sure the FITC committee receives many well-crafted applications. I would be honoured to attend FITC 2014 as part of the women’s initiative.
        </p>
        <p>
        Looking at the lineup for FITC 2014, I’m most humbled and excited to hear the talks by John Maeda, David Carson, and Stefan Sagmeister. My goal is to learn from them and continue to create experiences of which I can share with my community and my peers.
